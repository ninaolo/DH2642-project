# Project Idea

We have planned to do the `Meeting Agenda Builder` (with HTML + JavaScript) but to customize it so that it fulfills all goals for the DH2642 course. Below are some details on every goal.

## Several different views on the same model
* `Activities` view
* `Day` view (can be multiple at the same time)
* `Days` view (where you save your days/meetings and where you also can load them again from the database)
* `Add activity view

## Interaction on model data
* Drag and drop, change titles etc.
* We will use AngularJS for the frontend manipulation of data.

## External data through REST API & persist the data either by using a minimal backend
* We will use an external database (SQL) where we can store our models.
* In the `Day` view we will add a save button which stores the data in the database.
* We will use Java for REST routing.
